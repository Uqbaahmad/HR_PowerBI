# HR Dashboard

Human resources (HR) is the department of a company that is in charge of discovering, screening, recruiting, and training job candidates. It also handles employee-benefit programmes.
In the twenty-first century, human resources plays a critical role in assisting businesses in dealing with a rapidly changing business climate and a higher demand for quality people.

### Background of Analysis
This research was performed on the HR Analytics dataset, which is a popular dataset on the internet.
I received this dataset from a video I saw on the Data with Decision YouTube channel where the teacher was attempting to work with it, and I thought it was nice enough to do my analysis on it as well.

### Key Business Question:
1. What is the gender equality distribution among employee?
2. How many employers are satisfied with their jobs?
3. How much experience do employers have?
4. What is their job level?
5. How many departments does they have? And how many employers will retire from those department?

This is a multi page Human Resource Dashboard.
