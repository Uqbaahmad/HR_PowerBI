# HR Dashboard

Human resources (HR) is the department of a company that is in charge of discovering, screening, recruiting, and training job candidates. It also handles employee-benefit programmes.
In the twenty-first century, human resources plays a critical role in assisting businesses in dealing with a rapidly changing business climate and a higher demand for quality people.

### Background of Analysis
This research was performed on the HR Analytics dataset, which is a popular dataset on the internet.
I received this dataset from a video I saw on the [Data with Decision YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/DatawithDecision) where the teacher was attempting to work with it, and I thought it was nice enough to do my analysis on it as well.

### Data Analysis Process
Before analysing a dataset, there are various procedures you must take in order to make informed conclusions, and some of the processes I took were:
* Data Overview
* Data Preparation
* Data Visualization
* Insights and Recommendations

### Key Business Question:
1. How many total employers are there in the company?
2. What is the gender equality distribution among employee?
3. How many employers are satisfied with their jobs?
4. How much experience do employers have?
5. What is their job level?
5. Mention the total percentage due for promotion and not due for promotion.
6. Mention the total on service and retrench employers.
6. How many departments does they have? And how many employers will retire from those department?
7. How many employers will work overtime?

### Insights 
* The company does not have a proper arrangement of how employees should be promoted because from analysis, we can see that some employees have been in the company for too long and have never been promoted where some of them are going to be laid-off due to the number of years they've been in the company.
* The company does not have any arrangement regarding to enable the workers retire vountarily because we can see that some of those who are to be laid-off are younger than those who are still on service which shouldn't be so.

### Recommendation
* The company should have a documented plan as to how they would be promoting their staffs; this process could be, peculiar to each department/jon role but it should be deliberated upon by the board and implemented so no one is cheated in the process of serving.
* I would recommend that the company should set an age limit to enable people retire voluntarily and also there should be some retirement package for those who voluntarily retire from the company.
